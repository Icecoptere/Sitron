To make sure we are using the same module version, we should use a requirements.txt which contains all modules and
their versions, and makes it easier to install from one place to another

To generate it, best is to use pipreqs:

$ pipreqs . --force

will create a requirements.txt file which contains all modules and can then be installed using :

$ pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt



# Another way to list all modules is (but it lists all modules installed in the env, and not just the ones you use)

pip3 freeze > requirements_pip.txt
